# BeePlay - A Discord Bot Tailored for Classic Roleplay

## What is BeePlay?

BeePlay stands as a creation by KinyaDev, serving the purpose of facilitating the establishment of Roleplay Discord servers with customizable features and utilities geared towards traditional roleplay. In essence, BeePlay streamlines the management of your Discord Roleplay Server.

## Features

**Character Management and Customization**
Effortlessly manage and utilize your characters with these features:

- `/characters` displays a list of your characters with a selectable menu for easily switching between them.
- `/register` allows you to register a character, providing details such as name, icon, brackets, biography, and illustration.

Express your character's dialogue using custom brackets and text, akin to the functionality of Tupperbox Box. For instance, setting the brackets as `c!text` enables you to make your character speak with a unique user profile by sending messages like `c!Hello World` in a roleplay channel.

- `/unregister [character]` enables the deletion of a character from the database, ensuring privacy for both you and the server.

**Roleplay Channels & Travel System Based on View Channel Permissions**
Establish roleplay channels and connect them with a travel system based on channel permissions. No direct access to a sky island from the desert; travel to the mountain first!

- `/travel` displays a menu based on the roleplay channel you're in, allowing you to travel to other channels. It hides irrelevant roleplay channels and highlights the target channel.
- `/roleplay channels set [mention channels]`
- `/roleplay channels add [mention channels]`
- `/roleplay channels remove [mention channels]`
- `/roleplay channels link [mention channel] [mention channels]`
- `/roleplay channels unlink [mention channel]` presents options to delete the main roleplay channel with linked channels or unlink specific channels.
